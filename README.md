## Starwars CRUD

This project show a simple CRUD application based on API [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/api)

It is a basic CRUD just for Vehicles. Actually the first time when application starts, it load all data from API to local database (SQLite3).

The source code is divied in 2 modules: *api* and *web*.

*api* is the backend server, based on Koa & RxJS.

*web* is the frontend application, based on React/Redux/Redux-Observable.

To run the application locally, make sure you have SQlite3 installed and NPM or Yarn. Clone this repo and type the command listed above.

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

If all runs right, you must point out your browser to ```http://localhost:5000```. Any problem feel free to contact me or open an issue.

In the future I think to improve this demo with more features.

Regards.
